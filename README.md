# ai_hyakunin

ai_hyakunin is a collaborative project focused on exploring how Small Language Models (SLMs) can understand, interpret, or generate insights about the Hyakunin Isshu — a classic anthology of one hundred famous Japanese poems.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:**  
  To experiment with and understand the capabilities of SLMs in working with Japanese classical literature, specifically the Hyakunin Isshu.
- **Team Effort:**  
  This repository is developed and maintained by a team interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and Japanese poetry.

## What is Hyakunin Isshu?

Hyakunin Isshu (百人一首) is a collection of 100 poems written by 100 different poets, compiled in the 13th century. The anthology is highly regarded in Japanese culture, literature, and traditional games.

## What are SLMs?

SLM stands for Small Language Model. These are AI models designed to process and generate human language, but with smaller architectures than large-scale models like GPT.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze how SLMs interpret and process Hyakunin Isshu poems.
- Develop tools or models that can generate, translate, or explain the poems.
- Encourage collaborative exploration and learning about both Japanese poetry and AI.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/levi992025/ai_hyakunin.git
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the project’s code or notebooks (see `/notebooks` or `/src`).
